Descriptions of various algorithms in JavaScript

This is just a study project. It contains realisation of various algorithms in JavaScript.
Some of them are not the best readable or compact codes, but they are writen by newly self-educated
student, without any help and prompt.

Thank you for your interest, will be pleased of any feedback.
With best regards Ara Periyan.
